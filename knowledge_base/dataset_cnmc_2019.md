# Dataset: C-NMC 2019 (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia)

This project supports training on the C-NMC 2019 dataset (microscopic images for ALL challenge).
Key notes:
- Image data comes from blood/bone microscopy and is intended for research.
- Use subject-level splits when possible.
- Expect domain shift across labs (staining, microscope, illumination).

Always cite the dataset appropriately and follow the dataset's terms from the hosting platform (TCIA / Kaggle / HF mirror).
